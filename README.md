Homework 2 (Due Monday 9/20/21 at 11:59pm)
==========================================

This file is a work in progress.  The complete description of the assignment is available in the HTML file [`HW2.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JavaPLT/Assignment-2-Master/HW2.html) which will gradually converted to MD format within this file.  The converted text will appear just after this opening paragraph.  The HTML file HW2.html was easy to create from a Confluence Wiki file that we used last year.  So far our 
attempts to use software tools to convert HTML versions of our old wiki files to MD format suitable for GitHub have not produced clean results, so we are doing the conversions 
manually for now. The HTML file should be easy to read provided it is rendered by a browser.  The raw text in the HTML file is not very intelligible.  The following link above to 
`HW2.html` renders the file.
